/**
 * PixelFormat defines how pixel data is layed out in memory. 
 * Please, note that although pixel formats are defined for RGBA 
 * color spaces (or monochrome), they are also apply for YCbCr color spaces.
 * 
 * The following notation is used:
 * * Compoent name (R, G, B, A, Y or X) followed by its bit allocation
 * * Component name meanings:
 *   - R = Red (or Cr for YCbCr color models)
 *   - G = Green (or Y for YCbCr color models)
 *   - B = Blue (or Cb for YCbCr color models)
 *   - A = Alpha (transparency)
 *   - Y = Intensity for monochrome images (grayscale images)
 *   - X = Represents unused space. It's content will be ignored
 * * Components separated by an underscore "_" means the begining of a new plane.
 * * A _## at the end (for istance _32) represents that it is packed in ## bit CPU word(s).
 * 		This means that it will be endianess dependant
 * * A _S422 at the end means that it will have a 4:2:2 chroma subsampling scheme. 
 * * A _S420 at the end means that it will have a 4:2:0 chroma subsampling scheme.
